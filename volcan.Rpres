Summary
========================================================

A comprehensive set of information on global volcanic hazard, 
historical events, population exposure, 
vulnerability, and impact has been provided to GAR15 by Global Volcano Model (GVM)
and The International Association of Volcanology and 
Chemistry of the Earthâ€™s Interior (IAVCEI). 
This work is the first of its kind in global coverage and level of contribution 
from a wide network of experts and institutions around the world.

Instruction for using interactive ShinyApp application
========================================================
The Web link application: https://lukas1326.shinyapps.io/Volcano/ <br><br>
Instruction: <br> 
                 1. Choose in selection field the country <br> 
                 2. Explore the map zoomed by volcano place <br>
                 3. The purple or red dots are volcano's place. The red one is for highest risk <br>
                 4. The table below shows the subset from the original data by country <br>
                5. Note! When map display 'Map data not yet available',please Zoom in until the map will appear


Countries with the highest risk of volcano activity
========================================================
You can explore in detail the most risky volcano's countries before planning your vacation:
```{r high risk, echo = FALSE,warning=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("Volcano/data/volcano.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
risk3 <- df %>% filter(risk=="3")
z <- risk3 %>% count(risk,Country) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% top_n(5)
gg <-ggplot(z,aes(x=factor(z$Country,levels=z$Country),y=z$n)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + xlab("Country")+ ylab("Number of risk volcano's")
print(gg)
```
Active volcano
========================================================
Also, the information of the top numbers of active volcano's could be helpful too.  

```{r nz,echo = FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
risk4 <- df %>% filter(H_active=="1")
z <- risk4 %>% count(H_active,Country) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% top_n(5)
gg1 <-ggplot(z,aes(x=factor(z$Country,levels=z$Country),y=z$n)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + xlab("Country")+ ylab("Number of active volcano's")
print(gg1)
```
